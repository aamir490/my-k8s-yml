# **********************   -  DEPLOYMENT -  ( works with ReplicaSet )  ********************************

# Q :- What is the problem with  - RS & RC - ? 
# A :- When in manifest file chnage the version of image and update the manifest file by changing the image version,
#      and apply the image.    we are expecting  that pods are to be recreated with the latest version of image because
#      you updated the image & manifest file too, but in reality it is not happen. pods r still using old verson image
#      so we can not update the   - RS & RC - ... if we delete that pord only when will be created with the version of image
#      so its not updating we have to delete  - RS & RC - then apply . but if we delete -RS & RC- then we face Downtime.
#      and we are not achive zero downtine this is the reason we use    " Deployment "  .

# Deployment :--- ' Deployment '  is the recomended way to to deploy application in k8s.
#                   Deployment has a lot of feature like,,  Rolling update  &  we can Update the Deployment ( pods will be recreated,
#                   - you dont want to delete and apply again , we can scale up and scale down the Deployment , roll-back to verious version )
#                   Deployment create ReplicaSet and this ReplicaSet manage pods

# Deployment stategeis  :-   1-  ReCreate     2- RollingUpdate    3- BlueGreen / canary deployment / Red Black deployment

#  Recreate      :--  all of old pods r killed at once & get relaced all at once with the new once. 

#  RollingUpdate :--  standard default deployment to k8s. it works by slowly, one by one , replacing pods of the 
#                     previous version of your application with pods of the new  version without anycluster downtime.

#  BlueGreen     :--  ( instead of updating the deploymenet, you create deployment to 2 version of deployment and update traffic using service to achive BG deployment.)
#                      parallel  deployment .you have parallely differnt version of applications running in a different servers. 
#                    without disturing existing applications. you are creating other applications (eg: two version of the application running at the same time.}
