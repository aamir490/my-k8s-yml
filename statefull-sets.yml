# Deployment are usually used or 'stateless applications'
# Stateful::-  are applications that store data and keep tracking it. All databases, such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, are examples of stateful applin. 
# Stateless::- are applications,do not keep the data. Node.js and Nginx are examples of stateless applications. For each request, the stateless application will receive new data and process it.

# StatefulSet :- A StatefulSet is the k8s controller used to run the stateful application as containers (Pods) in the k8s cluster. 
#  StatefulSets assign a sticky identity—an ordinal number starting from zero—to each Pod instead of assigning random IDs for each replica Pod.
#  A new Pod is created by cloning the previous Pod’s data. If the previous Pod is in the pending state, then the new Pod will not be created. 
#  If you delete a Pod, it will delete the Pod in reverse order, not in random order.
